"Even broken in spirit as he is, no one can 
feel more deeply than he does the beauties of 
nature. The starry sky, the sea, and every 
sight afforded by these wonderful regions, 
seems still to have the power of elevating 
his soul from earth. Such a man has a double 
existence: he may suffer misery, and be 
overwhelmed by disappointments; yet, when he 
has retired into himself, he will be like a 
celestial spirit that has a halo around him, 
within whose circle no grief or folly 
ventures."
