"Oh! Be men, or be more than men. Be steady to 
your purposes and firm as a rock. This ice is 
not made of such stuff as your hearts may be; it
is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say 
that it shall not. Do not return to your 
families with the stigma of disgrace marked on 
your brows. Return as heroes who have fought 
and conquered, and who know not what it is to 
turn their backs on the foe." 
- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein
