Frankenstein
by Edward Field


The monster has escaped from 
the dungeon
where he was kept by the Baron,
who made him with knobs sticking 
out from each side of his neck
where the head was attached 
to the body
and stitching all over
where parts of cadavers were 
sewed together.

He is pursued by the ignorant 
villagers,
who think he is evil and dangerous
because he is ugly
and makes ugly noises.
They wave firebrands at him and 
cudgels and rakes,
but he escapes and comes to the 
thatched cottage
of an old blind man playing on the 
violin Mendelssohn's "Spring Song."

Hearing him approach, the blind man 
welcomes him:
"Come in, my friend," and takes 
him by the arm.
"You must be weary," and sits 
him down inside the house.
For the blind man has long dreamed 
of having a friend
to share his lonely life.

The monster has never known 
kindness â€¹ the Baron was cruel --
but somehow he is able to accept 
it now,
and he really has no instincts to 
harm the old man,
for in spite of his awful looks he 
has a tender heart:
Who knows what cadaver that part of 
him came from?

The old man seats him at table, 
offers him bread,
and says, "Eat, my friend." 
The monster
rears back roaring in terror.
"No, my friend, it is good. 
Eat -- gooood"
and the old man shows him how to eat,
and reassured, the monster eats
and says, "Eat -- gooood,"
trying out the words and finding 
them good too.

The old man offers him a 
glass of wine,
"Drink, my friend. Drink -- gooood."
The monster drinks, slurping 
horribly, and says,
"Drink -- gooood," in his deep 
nutty voice
and smiles maybe for the first 
time in his life.

Then the blind man puts a cigar 
in the monster's mouth
and lights a large wooden match 
that flares up in his face.
The monster, remembering the 
torches of the villagers,
recoils, grunting in terror.
"No, my friend, smoke -- gooood,"
and the old man demonstrates with 
his own cigar.
The monster takes a tentative puff
and smiles hugely, saying, 
"Smoke -- gooood,"
and sits back like a banker, 
grunting and puffing.

Now the old man plays Mendelssohn's 
"Spring Song" on the violin
while tears come into our dear 
monster s eyes
as he thinks of the stones of the 
mob the pleasures of meal-time,
the magic new words he has learned
and above all of the friend he 
has found.

It is just as well that he is 
unaware --
being simple enough to believe 
only in the present --
that the mob will find him and 
pursue him
for the rest of his short 
unnatural life,
until trapped at the 
whirlpool's edge
he plunges to his death.
