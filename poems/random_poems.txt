Than sculptured marble. They sing
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:


And both that morning equally lay
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,

O river, I see drifting


Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed 
Ripening on hill and plain;
When all at once I saw a crowd,
To where it bent in the undergrowth;

The massive castle turrets
Whose leaf is ever green;

And having perhaps the better claim,
If suddenly 
your poor,
And better than thy stroke; 
Life is but an empty dream!
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
Into my garden come!
Till time shall cease:
But though the pool is safe from storm
That murmur, soon replies: "God doth not need
What the hammer? what the chain,
your storied pomp!" cries she
She sees the sky look pale,
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 
The Crier's voice would tell me --
Prithee, my brother,
I keep on dying again.
Where sunless rivers weep
And sorry I could not travel both
for I shall already have forgotten you. 
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
Did those I loved repose
That cannot fly.
Hold fast to dreams
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
without leaving mine. 
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
that on that day, 
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
You were the wind and I the sea - 


She cannot fade, 
She came from very far
And death shall be no more; 
She cannot see the grain
In what distant deeps or skies.
Upon a mossy shore;
Thou art slave to fate, 
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
Rest, rest at the heart's core
Rotting flesh and worms do
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; 
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
the impalpable ash 
In vacant or in pensive mood,

Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
Small fists of sleeping
Where not a frost has been;
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
near the fire 
When old age shall this generation waste,
Find us farther than today.
By day, descant from borders

Act,—act in the living Present!
For ever piping songs for ever new;
Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Also of high windows. Worse
Life is a broken-winged bird
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
And hears the nightingale
Which is the bliss of solitude;
For oft, when on my couch I lie
And that has made all the difference.
There is no splendor any more,
Veins collapse, opening like the
Fair youth, beneath the trees,
Let us, then, be up and doing,

Sleep that no pain shall wake;
Will silent be; and not a soul to tell
That bears a human soul! 

What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
And twinkle on the milky way,
O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
in me all that fire is repeated, 
they serve him best. His state
aromas, light, metals, 
For now you must not listen, 
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
Hold fast to dreams
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,

And when thy heart began to beat,
A host, of golden daffodils;

if each day a flower 
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
that sail 
Heart within, and God o'erhead!
everything carries me to you, 
When I consider how my light is spent
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
though my soul more bent
lifeless things,
Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.
There is no frigate like a book
Scrim after scrim like fishnets

Of your ice-hearted calling-
Was not spoken of the soul.
Through sleep, as through a veil,
That sadly sings.
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
I doubted if I should ever come back.
The blue water-mists dropping
Long walks at night--
Beyond the mundane order,
Footprints, that perhaps another,
and my roots will set off 
In what furnace was thy brain?
And that one talent which is death to hide
Well, now, 
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
I keep on dying,
Learn to labor and to wait.
I have grown listless as the pool
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 

Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
Rest, rest, a perfect rest


"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all


‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
For the whorled ear's listening
If you think it long and mad, 
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Continuous as the stars that shine
She sleeps a charmed sleep:
You would not heed it, dear, 
if little by little you stop loving me 
I met a traveler from an antique land
Than ours, a friend to man, 
Led by a single star,

Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,
to leave me at the shore 
Will care at last when it is done.
Not convince me against
Without oppress of toll;

In the forests of the night;
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
Up toward me, troubling the face
I shall stop loving you little by little. 
For all its peace. 
She cannot feel the rain
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
They dull my eyes, yet
If those I loved were lost
one thing. 
Deranging by harmony

at that hour, 
Her face is toward the west,
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
And on the pedestal these words appear:

Rest, rest, for evermore
if I look 
How frugal is the chariot
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
Bear his mild yoke, 
 do not grieve;
Upon her hand.
though thou hast not thy bliss,
each hour, 
of the slow autumn at my window, 
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
And cold defeat live deep in
What little town by river or sea shore,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
And will my soul remember 
Her perfect peace.Lorelei
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Bears a burden too weighty
And looked down one as far as I could
to me,
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, 
And there is another sunshine,


For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
Here, in a well-steered country,
The purple land.
Under a balanced ruler.
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,
Drunkenness of the great depths.

For ever panting, and for ever young;
On what wings dare he aspire?

What the hand, dare seize the fire?
if each day, 
Lines along my face.
My true account, lest he returning chide,

Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Never mind silent fields -
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
And water'd heaven with their tears:

And things are not what they seem.
There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,

And then you could not hear. 
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
Had worn them really about the same,
With richness, hair heavier
Promising sure harborage;
Till joy shall overtake
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
And be one traveler, long I stood
A poet could not but be gay,
Of a world more full and clear
and you decide 
What immortal hand or eye,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

Now while my lips are living 
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
Be a hero in the strife!A_Psalm_of_Life

And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn

And wild plum trees in tremulous white; 
haunts about thy shape

and as long as you live 
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
We can make our lives sublime,
Deep in your flux of silver
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—

Never mind faded forests, Austin,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe 
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
Here is a little forest,

Lodg'd with me useless, 
Shed over brow and breast;
In the world's broad field of battle,

What the anvil? what dread grasp,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

All breathing human passion far above,
Yet if my soul remembered 
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Their waves into the deep,
if I touch 
She left the fields of corn,
Though it be darkness there;

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs 
In the bivouac of Life,
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
There is another sky,
Either man's work or his own gifts: who best

Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,

And then my heart with pleasure fills,

Which yet survive, stamped on these 
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.

Bore his riddle in!
Lives of great men all remind us

Nor I for you.

And summer's lease hath all too short a date:

Those great goddesses of peace.
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, 
I hear the bright bee hum:
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!

For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.
Still achieving, still pursuing,

Of hebetude, from the ledge
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, 
In such a jocund company:
watching tired housewives

Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
Awake her not.
In its unfading flowers

And the grave is not its goal;
Frozen with snow.

why swell'st thou then?
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
I wandered lonely as a cloud

For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
Nor any coursers like a page
And soonest our best men with thee do go,

Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
I shall lift my arms 
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
And, departing, leave behind us
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
Would scarcely know that we were gone. 
This traverse may the poorest take
of the heart where I have roots, 
HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
It is no night to drown in:
Life is a barren field
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
Funeral marches to the grave.

For when dreams go

With a heart for any fate;

To take us lands away,
Of prancing poetry.
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard

They also serve who only stand and wait."

If mankind perished utterly; 
If those I loved were found
What leaf-fring'd legend 

Though as for that the passing there

And what shoulder, and what art,
For twilight cold and lorn

with implacable sweetness, 
Even than your maddening
Tiger Tiger, burning bright,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
It grows more bitter than the sea,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
To seek where shadows are
Than can be. Sisters, your song
whose frown,
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Is our destined end or way;
peeking into windows
Robins will wear their feathery fire,
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; 
To speak when I am dead?

Could twist the sinews of thy heart?

From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,

What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

Still, like muffled drums, are beating

Though fishermen are sleeping,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Though winning near the goal yet,

Her pleasant lot.
Here is a brighter garden,
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Tiger Tiger burning bright,
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
Life is real! Life is earnest!

What wealth the show to me had brought:

Because I love to live. 
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
She left the rosy morn,
Their words must stay unsaid, 
Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
All stillness. Yet these shapes float
And dances with the daffodils.
In the forests of the night:
And not one will know of the war, not one
Ever serene and fair,

But to act, that each tomorrow
And from the tide has found surcease,
Of quiet. From the nadir
Along the margin of a bay:

To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Black beneath bland mirror-sheen,
A full moon, river lapsing

Your voices lay siege. You lodge
