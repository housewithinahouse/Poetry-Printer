In its unfading flowers
Stone, stone, ferry me down there.
Stand in the desert . . . Near them, 
For now you must not listen, 
Lines along my face.
If those I loved were found
Let the dead Past bury its dead!

And what shoulder, and what art,
Of prancing poetry.
And cold defeat live deep in
Well, now, 
Through sleep, as through a veil,
Did those I loved repose
Act,—act in the living Present!
Than can be. Sisters, your song
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
And better than thy stroke; 

Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
I hear the bright bee hum:

In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
With forest branches and the trodden weed;
Ever serene and fair,
near the fire 
And dances with the daffodils.
The bells of Ghent would ring --

Lives of great men all remind us
With richness, hair heavier
Where not a frost has been;
That bears a human soul! 
They also serve who only stand and wait."
Though it be darkness there;
Let us, then, be up and doing,
A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
You were the wind and I the sea - 
And water'd heaven with their tears:
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Footprints on the sands of time;—
All stillness. Yet these shapes float
And then you could not hear.

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
Would scarcely know that we were gone. 
And on the pedestal these words appear:
and as long as you live 
If mankind perished utterly; 
Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
And looked down one as far as I could
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.


When I consider how my light is spent
Heart within, and God o'erhead!
She cannot see the grain
And there is another sunshine,
your storied pomp!" cries she
In what distant deeps or skies.
And from the tide has found surcease,
Upon her hand.
Deep in your flux of silver
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
without leaving mine. 
A host, of golden daffodils;
Also of high windows. Worse

Her face is toward the west,
Rest, rest at the heart's core
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
The hand that mocked them, and the

Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,

A full moon, river lapsing

Beyond the mundane order,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies,

and my roots will set off 
lifeless things,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
And will my soul remember 
But to act, that each tomorrow
And sorry I could not travel both
Will silent be; and not a soul to tell

The massive castle turrets
Tiger Tiger burning bright,
They stretched in never-ending line
Frozen with snow. 
And, departing, leave behind us

The Crier's voice would tell me --
For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

She sleeps a charmed sleep:
aromas, light, metals, 
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Nor any coursers like a page

And every fair from fair sometime declines,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
Where sunless rivers weep
I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent

And hears the nightingale
Whose leaf is ever green;

Still achieving, still pursuing,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow


Which is the bliss of solitude;

to me,
heart that fed:

For ever warm and still to be enjoy'd,

Awake her not.
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
And things are not what they seem.


And then my heart with pleasure fills,
For all its peace. 
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
When old age shall this generation waste,
What wealth the show to me had brought:
And having perhaps the better claim,
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; 
Prithee, my brother,
Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Either man's work or his own gifts: who best
Robins will wear their feathery fire,

Of deities or mortals, or of both,
What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
There is no splendor any more,
do not look for me, 
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
The Daisy would impel me.
It grows more bitter than the sea,
Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
Death, thou shalt die.
When the stars threw down their spears
at that hour, 
Life is but an empty dream!
They rise, their limbs ponderous
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
of the slow autumn at my window, 
Though winning near the goal yet,
Black beneath bland mirror-sheen,
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;
that sail 
What immortal hand or eye,
Deranging by harmony
The purple land.
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Lodg'd with me useless, 

It is no night to drown in:
For ever panting, and for ever young;

Continuous as the stars that shine
In the forests of the night:

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
I shall be telling this with a sigh

Till time shall cease:
If you think it long and mad, 
Veins collapse, opening like the
Now while my lips are living 
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Though as for that the passing there
Of your ice-hearted calling-
Nor I for you.

Funeral marches to the grave.

And water springs.
I met a traveler from an antique land
Rotting flesh and worms do
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe 
Not convince me against
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
Learn to labor and to wait.

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
For oft, when on my couch I lie

Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Of a world more full and clear
To take us lands away,
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
Had worn them really about the same,
Sleep that no pain shall wake;
And when thy heart began to beat,
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
And that has made all the difference.
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
If those I loved were lost
Was not spoken of the soul.
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought
For the whorled ear's listening
Along the margin of a bay:
you forget me 
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
everything carries me to you, 
Small fists of sleeping
Led by a single star,
if I look 
They flash upon that inward eye
Long walks at night--
Beside the shore.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Will care at last when it is done.
chance, kings, and desperate men,
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
And be one traveler, long I stood
But thy eternal summer shall not fade

And the grave is not its goal;
 do not grieve;
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
I shall stop loving you little by little. 
And death shall be no more; 
as if everything that exists, 
For twilight cold and lorn
And that one talent which is death to hide
For if dreams die
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
And wild plum trees in tremulous white; 
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
Which yet survive, stamped on these 
Doubling themselves in a glass
Then took the other, as just as fair,
A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

I took the one less traveled by,
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; 
There is no frigate like a book
On what wings dare he aspire?
You know how this is: 
they serve him best. His state
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn
With a heart for any fate;
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay


that's what good for the soul:
What immortal hand or eye,
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!
In the world's broad field of battle,
of stone

Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.
The blue water-mists dropping
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
of the heart where I have roots, 
Find us farther than today.

Into my garden come!
To serve therewith my Maker, and present

I doubted if I should ever come back.
Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
A poet could not but be gay,
Here is a little forest,
I keep on dying again.
Rest, rest, a perfect rest
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
To speak when I am dead?
I have grown listless as the pool
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
Thou art slave to fate, 
Of hebetude, from the ledge

trying to fight off
O river, I see drifting
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
Hold fast to dreams
were little boats 
I want you to know
One short sleep past, we wake eternally
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
Here, in a well-steered country,
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Never mind silent fields -
My true account, lest he returning chide,
What the hammer? what the chain,
Drunkenness of the great depths.
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
Than ours, a friend to man, 
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
Hold fast to dreams
Upon a mossy shore;
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
you feel that you are destined for me 
She sees the sky look pale,
Till joy shall overtake
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Life is real! Life is earnest!
Even than your maddening


 thou canst not leave
Under a balanced ruler.
How frugal is the chariot

The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
"Keep, ancient lands, 
and you decide 
Night that no morn shall break

‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
All breathing human passion far above,
Memory of old tombs,
Their waves into the deep,
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,
In the bivouac of Life,

my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
remember 
free,
What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?

Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,


Bear his mild yoke, 

She cannot feel the rain
your poor,
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, 
To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:
I wandered lonely as a cloud
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
There is no magic any more,
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. 
Bears a burden too weighty
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
She left the fields of corn,
Those great goddesses of peace.
Your voices lay siege. You lodge

Children.

Than sculptured marble. They sing
Scrim after scrim like fishnets
For ever piping songs for ever new;
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
in me all that fire is repeated, 
Tiger Tiger, burning bright,
Of quiet. From the nadir
I shall lift my arms 
Song, your silence. At the source
You would not heed it, dear, 
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
What little town by river or sea shore,
Rest, rest, for evermore
But 
There is another sky,
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
And twinkle on the milky way,
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
Here is a brighter garden,
"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
They dull my eyes, yet
The challenge. The years
You work no miracle for me

on the sand,
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?
We can make our lives sublime,
Of night and light and the half-light,
This traverse may the poorest take
Footprints, that perhaps another,
"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

For when dreams go
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
if I touch 
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
We meet as other people do,
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
the impalpable ash 
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
In vacant or in pensive mood,
In such a jocund company:
And both that morning equally lay
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
Because I love to live. 
By day, descant from borders

Promising sure harborage;
Up toward me, troubling the face
