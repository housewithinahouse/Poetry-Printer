Seeing, shall take heart again.

I hear the bright bee hum:
And the grave is not its goal;
In vacant or in pensive mood,
Upon a mossy shore;
Small fists of sleeping
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
What the hand, dare seize the fire?
Dare its deadly terrors clasp!

A flowery tale more sweetly than our rhyme:
Tiger Tiger burning bright,
As doth eternity: Cold Pastoral!

I met a traveler from an antique land
What immortal hand or eye,
I keep on dying again.
She left the rosy morn,
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
do not look for me, 
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss,
And both that morning equally lay
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
Without oppress of toll;
And what shoulder, and what art,
Sylvan historian, who canst thus express
Either man's work or his own gifts: who best

Of deities or mortals, or of both,
Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,
And all her silken flanks with garlands drest?
Here, in a well-steered country,
And sorry I could not travel both
And, happy melodist, unwearied,
What immortal hand or eye,
Beyond the mundane order,
Rotting flesh and worms do
And dances with the daffodils.
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs 
Shed over brow and breast;

Promising sure harborage;
Act,—act in the living Present!
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
the impalpable ash 
A full moon, river lapsing
Heart within, and God o'erhead!
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
And on the pedestal these words appear:
And twinkle on the milky way,
Now while my lips are living 
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
The massive castle turrets
Let us, then, be up and doing,
Hold fast to dreams
Lines along my face.

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Into my garden come!
 thou canst not leave
to seek another land. 
You were the wind and I the sea - 
or the wrinkled body of the log, 
For if dreams die

Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Of night and light and the half-light,
Through sleep, as through a veil,
climbs up to your lips to seek me, 
And looked down one as far as I could
You would not heed it, dear, 
For ever piping songs for ever new;
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
To where it bent in the undergrowth;
Nor any coursers like a page
When all at once I saw a crowd,

Night that no morn shall break
and as long as you live 


Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
To what green altar, O mysterious priest,
Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,
Even than your maddening
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
And our hearts, though stout and brave,
Thou art slave to fate, 
HAD I the heavens' embroidered cloths,
lifeless things,
By day, descant from borders
All stillness. Yet these shapes float
with implacable sweetness, 
For oft, when on my couch I lie
Of your ice-hearted calling-
In leaves no step had trodden black.

The Crier's voice would tell me --
Because I love to live.

There is another sky,
For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!

Under a balanced ruler.

"Keep, ancient lands, 
She cannot feel the rain
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
And water'd heaven with their tears:
O river, I see drifting
Deep in your flux of silver
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe 
‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
She sees the sky look pale,
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
When old age shall this generation waste,

Deranging by harmony
I would spread the cloths under your feet:
Continuous as the stars that shine

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed 
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
Song, your silence. At the source
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Of a world more full and clear

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'

"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all

Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;

And that has made all the difference.
Long walks at night--
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;

On what wings dare he aspire?
Life is real! Life is earnest!
if little by little you stop loving me 
But though the pool is safe from storm
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,

On the pitched reefs of nightmare,
and you decide 
And wild plum trees in tremulous white; 
But to act, that each tomorrow
of stone
They stretched in never-ending line
In the bivouac of Life,
Though as for that the passing there
Is our destined end or way;
What mad pursuit? What struggle to escape?

of the slow autumn at my window, 
Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
Ripening on hill and plain;
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And when thy heart began to beat,

each hour, 
And frogs in the pools singing at night,
my love feeds on your love, beloved, 
And things are not what they seem.
Than can be. Sisters, your song
In such a jocund company:
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
ah my love, ah my own, 
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
She cannot fade, 
Is emptied of this folk, this pious morn?
Beside the shore.
Robins will wear their feathery fire,
I wandered lonely as a cloud
Enwrought with golden and silver light,
Tiger Tiger, burning bright,
Funeral marches to the grave.
In its unfading flowers
Here is a brighter garden,
There is no frigate like a book
Her face is toward the west,

Though it be darkness there;
to leave me at the shore 
The challenge. The years

Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
heart that fed:
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths
Though winning near the goal yet,
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
And, little town, thy streets for evermore
Thou, silent form, dost tease us out of thought

as if everything that exists, 
We meet as other people do,

Along the margin of a bay:
Never mind faded forests, Austin,
You know how this is: 
Here is a little forest,
If those I loved were lost
I keep on dying,

Life is but an empty dream!
I have spread my dreams under your feet;
Art is long, and Time is fleeting,
This traverse may the poorest take
Rest, rest at the heart's core
I shall lift my arms 
She sleeps a charmed sleep:
to whom thou say'st,
Though fishermen are sleeping,
When the stars threw down their spears
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:
Your voices lay siege. You lodge
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."
The Daisy would impel me.
When I consider how my light is spent
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, 
everything carries me to you, 
Would scarcely know that we were gone. 
With forest branches and the trodden weed;

And better than thy stroke; 
Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed
There is no splendor any more,
 do not grieve;
of the heart where I have roots, 
The waves beside them danced; but they
Led by a single star,
Or mountain-built with peaceful citadel,


Will care at last when it is done.
She cannot see the grain
All breathing human passion far above,
More happy love! more happy, happy love!
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,

Let the dead Past bury its dead!
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
It grows more bitter than the sea,
And be one traveler, long I stood
Lives of great men all remind us
And death shall be no more; 
What the hammer? what the chain,
Thou still unravish'd bride of quietness,
Where not a frost has been;

O Attic shape! Fair attitude! with brede

Memory of old tombs,
Stone, stone, ferry me down there.
And not one will know of the war, not one
But 
Awake her not.
I want you to know
In what distant deeps or skies.
And swallows circling with their shimmering sound; 
And every fair from fair sometime declines,

Bore his riddle in!
It is no night to drown in:
Their words must stay unsaid, 
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
How frugal is the chariot
And there is another sunshine,
Still achieving, still pursuing,
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
What dread hand? and what dread feet?
With a heart for any fate;


What pipes and timbrels? What wild ecstasy?
Death, thou shalt die.
What little town by river or sea shore,
Up toward me, troubling the face
For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow
One short sleep past, we wake eternally
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
Who are these coming to the sacrifice?
Lead'st thou that heifer lowing at the skies,
Veins collapse, opening like the

What men or gods are these? What maidens loth?
Where sunless rivers weep
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
Why thou art desolate, can e'er return.
Than ours, a friend to man, 
you forget me 
chance, kings, and desperate men,
What leaf-fring'd legend 
And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
Philip -- when bewildered
free,
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,
if each day a flower 
Yet if my soul remembered 
Never mind silent fields -
What the anvil? what dread grasp,
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
And water springs.
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
In what furnace was thy brain?
Of marble men and maidens overwrought,
Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire; 
though thou hast not thy bliss,
By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
That leaves a heart high-sorrowful and cloy'd,
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?
at the crystal moon, at the red branch 

Whose leaf is ever green;
In the forests of the night;
Till joy shall overtake
"Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?"

Life is a barren field
In the world's broad field of battle,
Hold fast to dreams
With richness, hair heavier
Thou foster-child of silence and slow time,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten, 
Rest, rest, a perfect rest

And, departing, leave behind us

For twilight cold and lorn

Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, 
Ever serene and fair,

Learn to labor and to wait.
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

And will my soul remember 
Footprints on the sands of time;—
Than sculptured marble. They sing

Not convince me against
Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!
Bear his mild yoke, 
That cannot fly.
In Tempe or the dales of Arcady?
A host, of golden daffodils;
They flash upon that inward eye
And cold defeat live deep in
And hears the nightingale
We can make our lives sublime,
For ever panting, and for ever young;
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Nor I for you.

To serve therewith my Maker, and present

For the whorled ear's listening

A poet could not but be gay,
And then you could not hear. 
Still, like muffled drums, are beating

I shall be telling this with a sigh
toward those isles of yours that wait for me. 
In the forests of the night:

The lone and level sands stretch far away."
Fair youth, beneath the trees,
If you think it long and mad,

watching tired housewives
A burning forehead, and a parching tongue.

Somewhere ages and ages hence:

The blue water-mists dropping

Which yet survive, stamped on these

Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;

To take us lands away,
To seek where shadows are
And from the tide has found surcease,

Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,

And then my heart with pleasure fills,
Black beneath bland mirror-sheen,
That bears a human soul! 

Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Sleep that no pain shall wake;
Of prancing poetry.

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Drunkenness of the great depths.
