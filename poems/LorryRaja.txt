WHAT HAPPENED was that my older brother, Siju, 
got a job as a lorry driver at the mine and 
started acting like a big shot. He stopped 
playing with Munna the way he used to, tossing 
him into the air like a sack of sand, making 
him sputter with laughter. When Amma asked him 
anything, he would give her a pitying look and 
not answer. He stopped speaking to his 
girlfriend, Manju, altogether. He taunted me 
about playing in the mud, as he called it, 
breaking chunks of iron ore with my hammer. 
With Appa especially he was reckless, not 
bothering to conceal his disdain, until he said
something about failed drivers who are only 
good for digging and drinking, and Appa 
Wrestled him to the ground and forced him to 
eat a handful of the red, iron-rich earth, 
shouting that this was our living now and he 
should bloody learn to respect it. Siju 
complained to the mine's labor officer, Mr. 
Subbu, but Mr. Subbu dismissed it as a domestic
matter and refused to interfere. After that, 
Siju maintained a glowering silence in Appa's 
presence. When Appa wasn't around, Siju sneered
at our tent, a swatch of blue plastic stretched
over a bamboo skeleton. Never mind that he was 
being paid half a regular driver's salary by 
the owner of the lorry, a paan-chewing Andhra 
fellow called Rajappa, because Siju was only 
fourteen and could not bargain for more.
